## Is the Pill Outdated? Development and Predictors of Hormonal Contraception in Germany

*Authored by Theresa Nutz and Nora MÃ¼ller*

The introduction of the contraceptive pill in the 1960s was a revolution in women's reproductive health, giving them control over their bodies and sexuality. 
However, while in sexual partnerships, both parties seek to prevent unwanted pregnancies, as the majority of contraceptives are designed for females, the primary contraceptive responsibility lies with women. 
This can exacerbate existing gender-related disparities, such as unequal distribution of household chores and childcare responsibilities.
<!-- Specifically the pill came with a number of health risks, which have been downplayed by medical professionals for many years. -->
Recent studies have shown a decrease in the use of hormonal contraception among younger women in Germany based on repeated cross-sectional data. 
This decline in hormonal contraception is likely due to a number of factors, including the rising awareness of the pill's health risks, the increasing availability of alternative contraceptive methods, and the changing social landscape around gender roles. 
Using longitudinal data from 14 waves of the German Family Panel surveyed between 2008 and 2021, we (1) compare the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analyse determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.
