    "text": "In this project we analyse contraceptual behavior and contraceptual decisions from a sociological perspective. We argue that contraceptual responsibility – mostly carried out by women – should be understood as a form of unpaid labor, adding to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women. Contraceptive behavior is therefore a highly relevant study object for social inequality research. Our project aims at establishing contraceptive responsibility as a dimension of social inequality and at showing how it is related to other dimension of social inequality.\n\n\n\nOur project consists of three subprojects.\nOur first subproject “Is the pill outdated? Development and predictors of hormonal contraception in Germany”, or short PillOut, is largely descriptive and aims at (1) comparing the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analysing the determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.\nOur second subproject “ContraScore” is of a methodological nature. Within this project, we develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks.\nIn our third subproject “Within-couple power dynamics, and the distribution of fertility work: Evidence from Germany”, or short FertilityWork, we study within-couple power dynamics and their relationship to and the distribution of fertility work within couples."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Authored by Theresa Nutz and Nora Müller\nThe introduction of the contraceptive pill in the 1960s was a revolution in women’s reproductive health. For the first time, women had unprecedented control over their fertility, enabling them to plan their families and pursue professional careers. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the use of hormonal contraception among younger women, as evidenced by cross-sectional data. This decline has coincided with increased public scrutiny of oral contraceptives, known as “pill scares,” which have highlighted a range of potential health risks associated with their use. Our study makes two key contributions. First, we examine whether the decline in hormonal contraceptive use among women is consistent across different birth cohorts or exhibits generational variation. Second, we use machine learning methods to analyze a broad range of potential predictor variables of hormonal contraceptive use and compare their predictive power across three birth cohorts.\nKeywords\nContraceptive behavior; contraceptive responsibility; pairfam; regression trees; random forest."

    "text": "Authored by Nora Müller, Katrin Firl, and Theresa Nutz\nWe develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks. Costs, risks and benefits are themselves multiple dimensions, consisting of several sub-dimensions, which we theoretically weight. These weights can be individually adjusted depending on the research question of interest or depending on the individual situation of potential contraceptive users. Our index thus serves two purposes: 1) It can be applied as a dependent or independent variable in sociological research, and 2) it can serve as an initial decision-making basis for choosing a suitable contraceptive. In this paper we describe the development of the ContraScore, we compare different contraceptive method based on their score and we present an interactive tool that allows for individual weighing of its different dimensions and sub-dimensions."

    "text": "Authored by Katrin Firl, Theresa Nutz, and Nora Müller\nPreventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships is a relationship task that both female and male partners want to achieve. However, most available modern contraceptives are female-body based, and women are predominantly responsible for birth control. Because (female) contraceptive responsibility can be connected to expenditures like financial costs, side effects, interference with body functions, or time costs, contraceptive responsibility has been termed unpaid ‘fertility work’. ‘Fertility work’ can add to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women. Hence, contraceptive responsibility is included as a dimension of unpaid labor in the context of the ‘gendered division of labor’.\nWe assume that different contraceptive methods are connected to different amounts of fertility work that an individual or couple needs to perform. Usually, female-body-based methods are associated with more expenditures and side effects than male-body-based methods. Our first research aim and contribution to the contraceptive literature is to categorize the different contraceptive methods within a metric scale of the amount of fertility work that needs to be performed.\nHow unpaid responsibilities are distributed within heterosexual couples is among others explained by within-couple resource allocations. In a second step, we will apply our ‘fertility responsibility scale’ to answer the research question of whether relative and absolute resources can be associated with the amount of fertility work women and men in heterosexual relationships perform. Following resource theory, we hypothesize that the partner with greater (relative or absolute) resources aims to minimize her or his own participation in unpaid labor, in our case, fertility work. We operationalize resources with income, level of education, and occupational status.\nWe use wave 1 of FReDA and analyze the cross-sectional relationship between women’s and men’s resources and the distribution of fertility work. Subsequently, we employ a fixed-effects approach, exploiting 14 waves of the German Family Panel ‘pairfam’.\nOur study extends prior research on the intersection of within-couple decision-making processes and fertility by pointing to the largely neglected relevance of contraceptive behavior for gender inequality."
