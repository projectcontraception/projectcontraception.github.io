    "text": "In this project we analyse contraceptual behavior and contraceptual decisions from a sociological perspective. We argue that contraceptual responsibility – mostly carried out by women – should be understood as a form of unpaid labor, adding to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women. Contraceptive behavior is therefore a highly relevant study object for social inequality research. Our project aims at establishing contraceptive responsibility as a dimension of social inequality and at showing how it is related to other dimension of social inequality.\n\n\n\nOur project consists of three subprojects.\nOur first subproject “Is the pill outdated? Development and predictors of hormonal contraception in Germany”, or short PillOut, is largely descriptive and aims at (1) comparing the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analysing the determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.\nOur second subproject “ContraScore” is of a methodological nature. Within this project, we develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks.\nIn our third subproject “Within-couple power dynamics, and the distribution of fertility work: Evidence from Germany”, or short FertilityWork, we study within-couple power dynamics and their relationship to and the distribution of fertility work within couples."

    "title": "Manage Multiple GitHub Accounts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Follow these instructions:\nThe need to manage multiple GitHub accounts on the same machine comes up at some point in time for most developers. Every single time I happen to change my Mac or need to Git push with a new work account, I end up surfing for the how to’s of something I have done over half a dozen times.\nMy laziness in not documenting the process and inability to remember the steps makes me spent a decent amount of time getting the bits and pieces from all over the web and then somehow making it work.\nI’m sure there are many of you who have been there, done that and many more of you who are just waiting for the next time the same thing occurs (myself included!). This endeavor is meant to help us all out.\n\nGenerating the SSH keys Before generating an SSH key, we can check to see if we have any existing SSH keys: ls -al ~/.ssh This will list out all existing public and private key pairs, if any.\n\nIf ~/.ssh/id_rsa is available, we can reuse it, or else we can first generate a key to the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa by running:\nssh-keygen -t rsa When asked for the location to save the keys, accept the default location by pressing enter. A private key and public key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub will be created at the default ssh location ~/.ssh/.\nLet’s use this default key pair for our personal account.\nFor the work accounts, we will create different SSH keys. The below code will generate the SSH keys, and saves the public key with the tag “email@work_mail.com” to ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1.pub\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C “email@work_mail.com” -f “id_rsa_work_user1” We have two different keys created:\n~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1 2. Adding the new SSH key to the corresponding GitHub account We already have the SSH public keys ready, and we will ask our GitHub accounts to trust the keys we have created. This is to get rid of the need for typing in the username and password every time you make a Git push.\nCopy the public key pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and then log in to your personal GitHub account:\nGo to Settings Select SSH and GPG keys from the menu to the left. Click on New SSH key, provide a suitable title, and paste the key in the box below Click Add key — and you’re done! For the work accounts, use the corresponding public keys (pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1.pub) and repeat the above steps in your GitHub work accounts. 3 . Registering the new SSH Keys with the ssh-agent To use the keys, we have to register them with the ssh-agent on our machine. Ensure ssh-agent is running using the command eval “$(ssh-agent -s)”. Add the keys to the ssh-agent like so:\n\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1\n\nMake the ssh-agent use the respective SSH keys for the different SSH Hosts.\nThis is the crucial part, and we have two different approaches:\nUsing the SSH configuration file (Step 4), and having only one active SSH key in the ssh-agent at a time (Step 5).\n\nCreating the SSH config File Here we are actually adding the SSH configuration rules for different hosts, stating which identity file to use for which domain.\n\nThe SSH config file will be available at ~/.ssh/config. Edit it if it exists, or else we can just create it.\n$ cd ~/.ssh/ $ touch config // Creates the file if not exists $ code config // Opens the file in VS code, use any editor Make configuration entries for the relevant GitHub accounts similar to the one below in your ~/.ssh/config file:\n\nPersonal account, - the default config\nHost github.com HostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nWork account-1\nHost github.com-work_user1\nHostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1 “work_user1” is the GitHub user id for the work account.\n“github.com-work_user1” is a notation used to differentiate the multiple Git accounts. You can also use “work_user1.github.com” notation as well. Make sure you’re consistent with what hostname notation you use. This is relevant when you clone a repository or when you set the remote origin for a local repository\nThe above configuration asks ssh-agent to:\nUse id_rsa as the key for any Git URL that uses @github.com Use the id_rsa_work_user1 key for any Git URL that uses @github.com-work_user1 5. One active SSH key in the ssh-agent at a time This approach doesn’t require the SSH config rules. Rather we manually ensure that the ssh-agent has only the relevant key attached at the time of any Git operation.\nssh-add -l will list all the SSH keys attached to the ssh-agent. Remove all of them and add the one key you are about to use.\nIf it’s to a personal Git account that you are about to push:\n$ ssh-add -D //removes all ssh entries from the ssh-agent $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa // Adds the relevant ssh key The ssh-agent now has the key mapped with the personal GitHub account, and we can do a Git push to the personal repository.\nTo push to your work GitHub account-1, change the SSH key mapped with the ssh-agent by removing the existing key and adding the SSH key mapped with the GitHub work account.\n$ ssh-add -D $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1 The ssh-agent at present has the key mapped with the work Github account, and you can do a Git push to the work repository. This requires a bit of manual effort, though.\nSetting the git remote Url for the local repositories Once we have local Git repositories cloned /created, ensure the Git config user name and email is exactly what you want. GitHub identifies the author of any commit from the email id attached with the commit description.\nTo list the config name and email in the local Git directory, do git config user.name and git config user.email. If it’s not found, update accordingly.\ngit config user.name “User 1” // Updates git config user name git config user.email “user1@workMail.com” 6. While Cloning Repositories Note: step 7 will help, if we have the repository already available on local.\nNow that the configurations are in place, we can go ahead and clone the corresponding repositories. On cloning, make a note that we use the host names that we used in the SSH config.\nRepositories can be cloned using the clone command Git provides:\ngit clone git@github.com:personal_account_name/repo_name.git The work repository will require a change to be made with this command:\ngit clone git@github.com-work_user1:work_user1/repo_name.git This change is made depending on the host name defined in the SSH config. The string between @ and : should match what we have given in the SSH config file.\n\nFor Locally Existing Repositories If we have the repository already cloned:\n\nList the Git remote of the repository, git remote -v\nCheck whether the URL matches our GitHub host to be used, or else update the remote origin URL.\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com-worker_user1:worker_user1/repo_name.git Ensure the string between @ and : matches the Host we have given in the SSH config.\nIf you are creating a new repository on local:\nInitialize Git in the project folder git init.\nCreate the new repository in the GitHub account and then add it as the Git remote to the local repository.\ngit remote add origin git@github.com-work_user1:work_user1/repo_name.git Ensure the string between @ and : matches the Host we have given in the SSH config.\nPush the initial commit to the GitHub repository:\ngit add . git commit -m “Initial commit” git push -u origin master We are done!\nAdding or updating the Git remote of the local Git directory with the proper host will take care of selecting the correct SSH key to verify our identity with GitHub. With all the above in place, our git operations should work seamlessly."

    "text": "In the landscape of reproductive health, a notable transformation has been unfolding in Germany over the past decades. The pill, once perceived as the pinnacle of hormonal contraception, has experienced a significant decline in popularity. Our latest research sheds light on a remarkable shift in the contraceptive choices of women in Germany, highlighting a growing preference for non-hormonal contraception methods.\nObserving women’s contraceptive behavior in data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) from 2008 to 2021, we witness a substantial decrease in the use of hormonal contraception. This decline is primarily attributed to the diminishing dominance of the pill as the primary method of choice. In 2008, almost 80% of women relied on hormonal contraception for managing their reproductive health. By 2021, this number has plummeted to 45%. Concurrently, the proportion of women using non-hormonal contraception more than doubled, rising from 20% to nearly 55%.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{nutz2023,\n  author = {Theresa Nutz},\n  title = {The Decreasing Use of Hormonal Contraception in {Germany}},\n  date = {2023-11-14},\n  url = {https://https://projectcontraception.github.io/posts/2023-11-14-PILLOUT_pill_decrease/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nTheresa Nutz. 2023. “The Decreasing Use of Hormonal Contraception\nin Germany.” November 14, 2023. https://https://projectcontraception.github.io/posts/2023-11-14-PILLOUT_pill_decrease/."

    "text": "Authored by Theresa Nutz and Nora Müller\nThe introduction of the contraceptive pill in the 1960s was a revolution in women’s reproductive health. For the first time, women had unprecedented control over their fertility, enabling them to plan their families and pursue professional careers. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the use of hormonal contraception among younger women, as evidenced by cross-sectional data. This decline has coincided with increased public scrutiny of oral contraceptives, known as “pill scares,” which have highlighted a range of potential health risks associated with their use. Our study makes two key contributions. First, we examine whether the decline in hormonal contraceptive use among women is consistent across different birth cohorts or exhibits generational variation. Second, we use machine learning methods to analyze a broad range of potential predictor variables of hormonal contraceptive use and compare their predictive power across three birth cohorts.\nKeywords\nContraceptive behavior; contraceptive responsibility; pairfam; regression trees; random forest."

    "text": "Authored by Nora Müller, Katrin Firl, and Theresa Nutz\nWe develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks. Costs, risks and benefits are themselves multiple dimensions, consisting of several sub-dimensions, which we theoretically weight. These weights can be individually adjusted depending on the research question of interest or depending on the individual situation of potential contraceptive users. Our index thus serves two purposes: 1) It can be applied as a dependent or independent variable in sociological research, and 2) it can serve as an initial decision-making basis for choosing a suitable contraceptive. In this paper we describe the development of the ContraScore, we compare different contraceptive method based on their score and we present an interactive tool that allows for individual weighing of its different dimensions and sub-dimensions."

    "text": "Authored by Katrin Firl, Theresa Nutz, and Nora Müller\nPreventing undesired pregnancies in different-sex relationships is a relationship task that both female and male partners want to achieve. However, most available modern contraceptives are female-body based, and women are predominantly responsible for birth control. Because (female) contraceptive responsibility can be connected to expenditures like financial costs, side effects, interference with body functions, or time costs, contraceptive responsibility has been termed unpaid ‘fertility work’. ‘Fertility work’ can add to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women. Hence, contraceptive responsibility is included as a dimension of unpaid labor in the context of the ‘gendered division of labor’.\nWe assume that different contraceptive methods are connected to different amounts of fertility work that an individual or couple needs to perform. Usually, female-body-based methods are associated with more expenditures and side effects than male-body-based methods. Our first research aim and contribution to the contraceptive literature is to categorize the different contraceptive methods within a metric scale of the amount of fertility work that needs to be performed.\nHow unpaid responsibilities are distributed within heterosexual couples is among others explained by within-couple resource allocations. In a second step, we will apply our ‘fertility responsibility scale’ to answer the research question of whether relative and absolute resources can be associated with the amount of fertility work women and men in heterosexual relationships perform. Following resource theory, we hypothesize that the partner with greater (relative or absolute) resources aims to minimize her or his own participation in unpaid labor, in our case, fertility work. We operationalize resources with income, level of education, and occupational status.\nWe use wave 1 of FReDA and analyze the cross-sectional relationship between women’s and men’s resources and the distribution of fertility work. Subsequently, we employ a fixed-effects approach, exploiting 14 waves of the German Family Panel ‘pairfam’.\nOur study extends prior research on the intersection of within-couple decision-making processes and fertility by pointing to the largely neglected relevance of contraceptive behavior for gender inequality."
