## Project goal 

In this project we analyse contraceptual behavior and contraceptual decisions from a sociological perspective. 
We argue that contraceptual responsibility -- mostly carried out by women -- should be understood as a form of unpaid labor, adding to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women.
Contraceptive behavior is therefore a highly relevant study object for social inequality research. 
Our project aims at establishing contraceptive responsibility as a dimension of social inequality and at showing how it is related to other dimension of social inequality.

## Our subprojects

Our project consists of three subprojects. 

Our first subproject "Is the pill outdated? Development and predictors of hormonal contraception in Germany", or short [PillOut](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp1.html), is largely descriptive and aims at  (1) comparing the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analysing the determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.

Our second subproject ["ContraScore"](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp2.html) is of a methodological nature. 
Within this project, we develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. 
The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks. 

In our third subproject "Within-couple power dynamics, and the distribution of fertility work: Evidence from Germany", or short [FertilityWork](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp3.html), we study within-couple power dynamics and their relationship to and the distribution of fertility work within couples.
