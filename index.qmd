## Project goal 

In this project we analyse contraceptual behavior and contraceptual decisions from a sociological perspective. 
We argue that contraceptual responsibility should be understood as a form of unpiad labor, adding to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women.
Contraceptive behavior is therefore a highly relevant study object for social inequality research. 
On the one hand, it constitutes an inequality dimension itself, and on the other hand, it should be strongly correlated with other inequality dimensions.

The aim of our project is to show that, in addition to the gender pay gap and the gender care gap, there exists also a gender contraception gap and to analyze how the gender contraception gap is related to other social inequality dimensions.

## Our Subprojects

Our project consist of three subprojects. 

Our first subproject "Is the Pill Outdated? Development and Predictors of Hormonal Contraception in Germany", or short [PillOut](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp1.html), is largely descriptive and aims at  (1) comparing the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analysing the determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.

Our second subproject ["ContraScore"](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp2.html) is of a methodological nature. 
Within this project, we develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. 
The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks. 

In our third subproject "Within-couple power dynamics, and the distribution of fertility work: Evidence from Germany", or short [FertilityWork](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp3.html), we study within-couple power dynamics and their relationship to and the distribution of fertility work within couples.
