## Project goal 

[...]

## Subprojects

Our project consits of three subprojects. 

Our [first subproject](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp1.html) is largely descriptive and aims at  (1) comparing the development of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception use of women of across three birth cohorts (1971-73, 1981-83, 1991-93), and (2) analysing the determinants of hormonal and non-hormonal contraception and their change over time.

Our [second subproject](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp2.html) is of a methodological nature. 
Within this project, we develop a formative multidimensional index to measure risks, costs and benefits of contraceptive choices. 
The resulting measure gives a score that relates the benefits of a contraceptive method to its costs and risks. 

In our [third subproject](https://projectcontraception.github.io/sp3.html) we study within-couple power dynamics and their relationship to and the distribution of fertility work within couples.
